3. **Forecasting Engine** - Implements time series forecasting algorithms
4. **Visualization Layer** - Creates visual representations of insights
5. **Web Dashboard** - Provides interactive access to analytics results

## Component Details

### 1. Data Processing Layer

The data processing layer is responsible for loading, cleaning, and integrating data from multiple sources. It supports both standard pandas processing for medium-sized datasets and Spark-based processing for large-scale data.

**Key Files:**
- `data_preprocessing.py` - Core data preparation functions

- Anomaly detection and handling
- Referential integrity checking
- Date and timestamp normalization

**Data Flow:**
1. Raw CSV files are loaded from the data directory
2. Data is validated for required columns and data types
3. Missing values are imputed using context-appropriate strategies
4. Derived features are calculated (e.g., processing time, delivery days)
5. Data is merged into a unified dataset for analysis

### 2. Analytics Engine

The analytics engine performs the core analytical operations on the preprocessed data, including segmentation, clustering, and pattern recognition.

**Key Files:**
- `main.py` - Main orchestration script
- `supplier_analyzer.py` - Supplier performance clustering
- `run_analysis.py` - Analysis execution script

**Key Features:**
- Supplier performance clustering using K-means
- Geographical demand pattern analysis
- Product category segmentation
- Performance metrics calculation

**Analytics Workflow:**
1. Monthly demand patterns are analyzed by product category
2. Suppliers are clustered into performance tiers based on multiple metrics
3. Geographical patterns are identified through regional aggregation
4. Supply chain performance metrics are calculated

### 3. Forecasting Engine

The forecasting engine implements time series forecasting algorithms to predict future demand patterns.

**Key Files:**
- `arima_forecasting.py` - ARIMA-based forecasting implementation

**Key Features:**
- ARIMA/SARIMA forecasting with automatic parameter selection
- Seasonality detection and handling
- Forecasting accuracy metrics (MAPE, RMSE)
- Confidence interval calculation
- Growth rate estimation

**Forecasting Process:**
1. Time series data is tested for stationarity
2. Optimal ARIMA parameters are determined
3. Models are validated on historical data
4. Forecasts are generated with confidence intervals
5. Results are evaluated for accuracy

### 4. Visualization Layer

The visualization layer creates graphical representations of the analytical insights for easier comprehension.

**Key Files:**
- `visualization_module.py` - Backend visualization utilities

**Key Features:**
- Demand trend visualizations
- Supplier cluster visualizations
- Geographical heat maps
- Reorder recommendation charts
- Performance metric dashboards

### 5. Web Dashboard

The web dashboard provides an interactive interface for exploring the analytical results.

**Key Files:**
- Frontend React components in `frontend/src/pages/` and `frontend/src/components/`
- `server/server.js` - Backend API server

**Key Features:**
- Interactive demand forecast visualization
- Supplier performance exploration
- Geographical analysis maps
- Inventory recommendations dashboard
- KPI summary cards

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis

```python
from backend.main import run_analysis

# Run the analysis with default parameters
results = run_analysis(data_dir="./data", output_dir="./output")
```

### Spark-Based Analysis for Big Data

```python
from backend.spark_implementation import run_spark_analysis

# Run the analysis with Spark for large datasets
results = run_spark_analysis(
    data_dir="./data", 
    output_dir="./output", 
    top_n=20,
    forecast_periods=12
)
```

### Custom Forecasting

```python
from backend.arima_forecasting import DemandForecaster

# Create a forecaster with custom settings
forecaster = DemandForecaster("demand_data.csv")
forecaster.use_auto_arima = True
forecaster.seasonal = True
forecaster.seasonal_period = 12  # Monthly data

# Run forecasts and generate report
forecasts = forecaster.run_all_forecasts(top_n=10, periods=6)
report = forecaster.generate_forecast_report("forecast_report.csv")
```

## Conclusion

The Supply Chain Analytics system provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing supply chain data, forecasting demand, and optimizing inventory. Its modular architecture allows for flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for businesses of varying sizes and with different data volumes.
